### 🧠 Long-Term Memory (LTM)

Long-term memory stores information for hours, days, years, or even a lifetime. It is typically divided into two main branches:


#### 1. Explicit (Declarative) Memory

Memories you can consciously recall and talk about.

- Episodic Memory:
Personal experiences and events, tied to a time and place. **Stores experience.**

→ *E.g., “My graduation day”*

- Semantic Memory:
Facts, general knowledge, concepts not linked to specific experiences. **Stores knowledge**

→ *E.g., “Paris is the capital of France”*

#### 2. Implicit (Non-declarative) Memory

Memories that influence behavior without conscious awareness. **Stores skills**

- Procedural Memory:
Skills and habits, like riding a bike or typing.
→ *E.g., “I know how to play the piano” (but I can’t explain every finger movement)*
