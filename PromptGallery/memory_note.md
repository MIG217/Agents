## 🧠 Long-Term Memory (LTM)

Long-term memory stores information for hours, days, years, or even a lifetime. It is typically divided into two main branches:


### 1. Explicit (Declarative) Memory

Memories you can consciously recall and talk about.

- Episodic Memory:
Personal experiences and events, tied to a time and place. **Stores experience.**

→ *E.g., “My graduation day”*

- Semantic Memory:
Facts, general knowledge, concepts not linked to specific experiences. **Stores knowledge**

→ *E.g., “Paris is the capital of France”*

### 2. Implicit (Non-declarative) Memory

Memories that influence behavior without conscious awareness. **Stores skills**

- Procedural Memory:
Skills and habits, like riding a bike or typing.
→ *E.g., “I know how to play the piano” (but I can’t explain every finger movement)*

### 🧩 Quick Summary Table

|Type	| Category	| Example |
|---|---|---|
|Episodic|	Explicit	|Remembering your birthday party|
|Semantic|	Explicit	|Knowing what a “cat” is|
|Procedural|	Implicit|	Knowing how to swim|


## 🧠 What is Sensory Memory?

Sensory memory is the ultra-short-term memory system that stores raw sensory input (like sights, sounds, smells) for just a fraction of a second to a few seconds.

It’s like your brain’s “buffer zone” for quickly processing input before deciding whether to pass it into short-term memory.

### 🧩 Types of Sensory Memory:

|Type	| Sense| 	Duration|	Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Iconic memory|	Vision 👀|	~0.5 seconds	|The afterimage when you close your eyes after a flash|
|Echoic memory|	Hearing 👂|	~3–4 seconds	|You can “hear” the last sentence even if you weren’t paying attention|
|Haptic memory|	Touch ✋|	~2 seconds	|Feeling your phone vibrate right after it stops|

There are also less-researched types for smell (olfactory) and taste (gustatory).

### 🔄 Flow of Memory Stages:
1. Sensory Memory →
2. If attention is given: Short-Term / Working Memory →
3. If rehearsed and encoded: Long-Term Memory

### 🧠 Real Life Analogy:

Imagine walking into a room and hearing music. You instantly recognize it — that initial recognition is powered by sensory memory. If you focus on it, you can remember more. If not, it fades quickly.
