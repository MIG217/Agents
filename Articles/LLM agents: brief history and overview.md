- What are LLM Agents?
- A brief history of LLM Agents
  - In the recent context of "LLM"
  - In the ancient context of "agents"
- On the future of LLM Agents

## 1. What is an Agent?

To understand LLM agents, we need to break the term into two parts: LLM and Agent. While LLM are widely known, the term "agent" requires further clarification.

In the context of AI, "agent" is a broad term encompassing various system- from autonomous vehicles and Go-playing algorithms to video game AI and conversional interfaces.

### 1.1 What is an agent?

In AI, an agent is an **"intelligent"** system that interacts with an **"environment"**. The type of agent depends on the nature of the environment:

- **Physical environments**: robots, autonomous vehicles, etc.
- **Digital environments**: DQN for Atari games, Siri, AlphaGo
- **Humans as environments**: Chatbots

To properly define an "agent," we must first establish what constitutes "intelligence" and what comprises an "environment.

- The concept of intelligence in AI is not static but dynamic!
- Exercise question: How would you define "intelligence"?
