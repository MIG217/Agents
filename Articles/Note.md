### What about retrieval and RAG?

- We can think of the retriveal corpus as "read-only" LTM (Long Term Memory)
  - Written by others (e.g., Wikipedia editors), not the agent itself
  - Retrieval[query]: a read action
 
- Limitations
  - Can only live "others' experience", which might not
  - The way corpus is written might not be optimal for

 - **Possible Improvement:** 
  - Agent memory: also be able to autonomously write to it!
